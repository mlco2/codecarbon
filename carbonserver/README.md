Container Dependencies injection : 



Database is a core part of the application, used with 2 different usages :
- Administration, with alembic to create / populate tables.
- Data persistence, for users data, through the HTTP layer.

The load of data would not be the same for those 2 usages, thus we must define 2 types of database connections for them.
To handle properly the connexion / session, we could define it as part of the infrastructure & keep in the database 
folder the high level functions that manipulates tested session building.
A software based on dependency injector :

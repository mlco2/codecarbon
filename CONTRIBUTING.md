Feel free to describe your request by [submitting an issue](#issue) documenting the feature (with its intent) and a PR with a proposed implementation of the feature.




## <a name="process"></a> Ready to Contribute!

### <a name="issue"></a> Create an issue

Before submitting a new issue, please search the issues to make sure there isn't a similar issue already.
New issues can be created with in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon/issues/new).


### Installation


Create a virtual environment using `conda` for easier management of dependencies and packages.
For installing conda, follow the instructions on the [official conda website](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/)

```bash
conda create --name codecarbon python=3.8
conda activate codecarbon
```

Install from sources in development mode :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon
pip install -e .
```


### Tests


Make sure that the [`tox` package](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example/package.html) is available to run tests and debug:

```
pip install tox
```

You can run tests by simply entering tox in the terminal when in the root package directory, and it will run the unit tests.

```
tox
```

This will not run test that may failed because of your environment (no CO2 Signal API token, no PowerGadget...), if you want to run all package tests :

```
tox -e all
```

You can also test your specific test in an isolated fashion to develop and debug them:

```
$ python -m unittest tests.test_your_feature

# or

$ python -m unittest tests.test_your_feature.YourTestCase.test_function
```

To test the API, see [how to deploy it](#local_deployement) first.


Core & external classes are unit tested, with one test file per class. Mosts pull-requests are expected to contains new tests or test update, if you are unusure what to test / how to test it, please put it in the pull-request description and the maintainers will help you.


### Versionning


To add a new feature to codecarbon, the following workflow is applied :
- Master branch is protected
- To contribute to an already [prioritized](https://github.com/orgs/mlco2/projects/1) feature, you can create a branch from master and open a draft PR
- Documenting the intent & the limits of a contribution in a dedicated issue or in the pull request helps the review
- Once automated tests pass, the PR is reviewed and merged by the repository maintainers


### <a name="local_deployement"></a> Local deployment

## CSV Dashboard

To install dependencies:
```
pip install codecarbon["viz"]
```

To run locally the dashboard application, you can use it out on a sample data file such as the one in `examples/emissions.csv`, and run it with the following command from the code base:
```bash
python codecarbon/viz/carbonboard.py --filepath="examples/emissions.csv"
```

If you have the package installed, you can run the CLI command:

```bash
carbonboard --filepath="examples/emissions.csv" --port=xxxx
```

## API Dashboard

To install dependencies:
```
pip install codecarbon["dashboard"]
```

To test the new dashboard that uses the API, run:

```bash
python carbon_board_API.py
```

Then, click on the url displayed in the terminal.

### Coding style && Linting

The coding style and linting rules are automatically applied and enforce by [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). This tool helps to maintain the same code style across the code-base to ease the review and collaboration process. Once installed ([https://pre-commit.com/#installation](https://pre-commit.com/#installation)), you can install a Git hook to automatically run pre-commit (and all configured linters/auto-formatters) before doing a commit with `pre-commit install`. Then once you tried to commit, the linters/formatters will run automatically. It should display something similar to:

```
[INFO] Initializing environment for https://github.com/psf/black.
[INFO] Initializing environment for https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8.
[INFO] Installing environment for https://github.com/psf/black.
[INFO] Once installed this environment will be reused.
[INFO] This may take a few minutes...
[INFO] Installing environment for https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8.
[INFO] Once installed this environment will be reused.
[INFO] This may take a few minutes...
seed isort known_third_party.............................................Passed
isort....................................................................Failed
- hook id: isort
- files were modified by this hook

Fixing codecarbon/__init__.py

black....................................................................Passed
flake8...................................................................Passed
```

If any of the linters/formatters failed, check the difference with `git diff`, add the differences if there is no behavior changes (isort and black might have change some coding style or import order, this is expected it is their jobs) with `git add` and finally try to commit again `git commit ...`.

You can also run `pre-commit` with `pre-commit run -v` if you have some changes staged but you are not ready yet to commit.


### Packaging

Dependencies are defined in three different places:

- In [setup.py](setup.py#L7), those are the dependencies for the Pypi package.
- In [.conda/meta.yaml](.conda/meta.yaml#L21), those are the dependencies for the Conda pacakge targeting Python 3.7 and higher versions.

We drop support of Python 3.6 since version 2.0.0 of CodeCarbon.

### Alternative ways of contributing


You have a cool idea, but do not know know if it fits with Code Carbon ? You can create an issue to share :
- the code, via the Github repo or [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), to share executable notebooks
- a webapp, using [Voil√†](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila), [Dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash) or [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit)
- ideas for improvement about the tool or its documentation

### <a name="documentation"></a>Build Documentation üñ®Ô∏è
No software is complete without great documentation!
To make generating documentation easier, install the [`sphinx` package](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html#installation-from-pypi) and use it to edit and improve the existing documentation:
```
cd docs/edit
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme

```
In order to make changes, edit the `.rst` files that are in the `/docs/edit` folder, and then run:
```
cd docs/edit
source .venv/bin/activate
make docs
```
to regenerate the html files.

### Release process

- Merge all PRs.
- Create a PR bumping the version in https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon/blob/master/setup.py, https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon/blob/master/codecarbon/__init__.py and https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon/blob/master/.conda/meta.yaml.
- Run `python3 .github/check_version.py` to check version consistancy.
- [Build Documentation](#documentation) if needed.
- Merge the PR.
- Wait for the Github Action `ReleaseDrafter` to finish running on the merge commit.
- [Edit the Draft release](https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon/releases/) on Github and give it a tag, `v1.0.0` for the version 1.0.0. Github will automatically create a Git tag for it. Complete help [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository).
- A [Github Action](https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon/actions) _Upload Python Package_ will be run automaticaly to upload the package.
- For conda, we now have a [feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/codecarbon-feedstock/pulls) to publish to Conda-Forge channel.


If you still want to publish to the Anaconda Codecarbon channel:

Start a Docker image in the same directory and bind-mount the current directory with:

`docker run -ti --rm=true -v $PWD:/data continuumio/anaconda3`.

Inside the docker container, run:
- `conda install conda-build conda-verify`
- `cd /data && mkdir -p conda_dist`
- `conda build --python 3.8 .conda/ -c conda-forge --output-folder conda_dist`
- `anaconda upload --user codecarbon /data/noarch/codecarbon-*.tar.bz2`


### API

To run the API locally, the easiest way is Docker. Launch this command in the project directory:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
Please see [Docker specific documentation](./docker/README.md) for more informations.
When up, the API documentation is locally available at the following URL : http://localhost:8008/redoc and can be used for testing.


In order to connect make codecarbon automatically connect to the local API, create a file `.codecarbon.config` with the content:
```
[codecarbon]
api_endpoint = http://localhost:8008
```

Before using it, you need an experiment_id, to get one, run:
```
codecarbon init
```

It will ask the API for an experiment_id on the default project and save it to `.codecarbon.config` for you.

Then you could run an example:
```
python examples/api_call_debug.py
```

üìù Edit the line `occurence = 60 * 24 * 365 * 100` to specify the number of minutes you want to run it.
#### Deployment

##### API

The API is availiable to everyone from https://api.codecarbon.io but if you want to deploy it for yourself, here is the instructions.

To deploy the API we use [Clever Cloud](https://www.clever-cloud.com/) , an IT Automation platform. They manage all the hard ops work while we focus on the Code Carbon value.

Here is the Clever Cloud configuration if you want to reproduce it :
```
APP_FOLDER="carbonserver"
CC_PIP_REQUIREMENTS_FILE="requirements.txt"
CC_POST_BUILD_HOOK="cd $APP_HOME/carbonserver && python3 -m alembic -c carbonserver/database/alembic.ini upgrade head"
CC_PYTHON_BACKEND="uvicorn"
CC_PYTHON_MODULE="main:app"
CC_PYTHON_VERSION="3.8"
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://secret_do_not_publish_this"
PORT="8080"
```
_CC stand here for Clever Cloud, not Code Carbon_ üòâ

To deploy,
```
git remote add deploy git+ssh://git@push-n2-par-clevercloud-customers.services.clever-cloud.com/app_<secret_do_not_share>.git
git push deploy master:master
```
Yeah, no so hard, isn't it ?

See (the doc)[https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc/getting-started/quickstart/] for more informations.

Please note that Clever Cloud host Code Carbon for free because they like our project.

##### Dashboard

Same as for the API, for example to deploy the branh `fix-unit` to CleverCloud:
```sh
git push clever-dashboard fix-unit:master
```

Config on CleverCloud:
```sh
APP_FOLDER="dashboard"
CC_PIP_REQUIREMENTS_FILE="requirements-new.txt"
CC_PYTHON_MODULE="carbon_board_API:server"
CC_PYTHON_VERSION="3.8"
CODECARBON_API_URL="https://api.codecarbon.io"
PORT="8000"
```

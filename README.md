# About CodeCarbon 💡

**CodeCarbon** started with a quite simple question:

**What is the carbon emission impact of my computer program? :shrug:**

We found some global data like "computing currently represents roughly 0.5% of the world’s energy consumption" but nothing on our individual/organisation level impact.

At **CodeCarbon**, we believe, along with Niels Bohr, that "Nothing exists until it is measured". So we found a way to estimate how much CO<sub>2</sub> we produce while running our code.

*How?*

We created a Python package that estimates your hardware electricity power consumption (GPU + CPU + RAM) and we apply to it the carbon intensity of the region where the computing is done.

![calculation Summary](docs/edit/images/calculation.png)

We explain more about this calculation in the [**Methodology**](https://mlco2.github.io/codecarbon/methodology.html#) section of the documentation.

Our hope is that this package will be used widely for estimating the carbon footprint of computing, and for establishing best practices with regards to the disclosure and reduction of this footprint.

**So ready to "change the world one run at a time"? Let's start with a very quick set up.**

# Quickstart 🚀

## Installation 🔧

**From PyPI repository**
```python
pip install codecarbon
```

**From Conda repository**
```python
conda install -c codecarbon codecarbon
```
To see more installation options please refer to the documentation: [**Installation**](https://mlco2.github.io/codecarbon/installation.html#)

## Start to estimate your impact 📏

### Without using the online dashboard

```python
from codecarbon import track_emissions
@track_emissions()
def your_function_to_track():
  # your code
```

After running your code, you will find an `emissions.csv` that you can visualize with `carbonboard --filepath="examples/emissions.csv"`.

### With the online dashboard

To use the online dashboard you need to create an account on [**CodeCarbon Dashboard**](https://dashboard.codecarbon.io/).
Once you have an account, you can create an experiment_id to track your emissions.

To get an experiment_id enter:
```python
! codecarbon login
```
You can now store it in a **.codecarbon.config** at the root of your project
```python
[codecarbon]
log_level = DEBUG
save_to_api = True
experiment_id = 2bcbcbb8-850d-4692-af0d-76f6f36d79b2 #the experiment_id you get with init
```
Now you have 2 main options:

### Monitoring your machine 💻

In your command prompt use:
```codecarbon monitor```
The package will track your emissions independently from your code.

### In your Python code 🐍
```python
from codecarbon import track_emissions
@track_emissions()
def your_function_to_track():
  # your code
  ```
The package will track the emissions generated by the execution of your function.

There is other ways to use **codecarbon** package, please refer to the documentation to learn more about it:  [**Usage**](https://mlco2.github.io/codecarbon/usage.html#)

## Visualize 📊

You can now visualize your experiment emissions on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.codecarbon.io/).

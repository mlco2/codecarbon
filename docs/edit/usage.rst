Quickstart
==========
The CO2 tracking tool can be used along with any computing framework. It supports both ``online`` (with internet access) and
``offline`` (without internet access) modes. The tracker can be used in the following ways:


Online Mode
-----------
When the environment has internet access, the ``EmissionsTracker`` object or the ``track_emissions`` decorator can be used, which has
``offline`` parameter set to ``False`` by default.

Command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~


Create a minimal configuration file (just follow the prompts) :

.. code-block:: console

  codecarbon config

.. image:: https://asciinema.org/a/667970.svg
            :align: center
            :alt: Init config
            :target: https://asciinema.org/a/667970

You can use the same command to modify an existing config :

.. image:: https://asciinema.org/a/667971.svg
            :align: center
            :alt: Modify config
            :target: https://asciinema.org/a/667971


If you want to track the emissions of a computer without having to modify your code, you can use :

.. code-block:: console

    codecarbon monitor

You have to stop the monitoring manually with ``Ctrl+C``.

In the following example you will see how to use the CLI to monitor all the emissions of you computer and sending everything
to an API running on "localhost:8008" (Or you can start a private local API with "docker-compose up"). Using the public API with
this is not supported yet (coming soon!)

.. image:: https://asciinema.org/a/667984.svg
            :align: center
            :alt: Monitor example
            :target: https://asciinema.org/a/667984


The command line could also works without internet by providing the country code like this:

.. code-block:: console

    codecarbon monitor --offline --country-iso-code FRA

Implementing CodeCarbon in your code allows you to track the emissions of a specific block of code.

Explicit Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the case of absence of a single entry and stop point for the training code base, users can instantiate a ``EmissionsTracker`` object and
pass it as a parameter to function calls to start and stop the emissions tracking of the compute section.

.. code-block:: python

   from codecarbon import EmissionsTracker
   tracker = EmissionsTracker()
   tracker.start()
   try:
        # Compute intensive code goes here
        _ = 1 + 1
   finally:
        tracker.stop()

This mode is recommended when using a Jupyter Notebook. You call ``tracker.start()`` at the beginning of the Notebook, and call ``tracker.stop()`` in the last cell.

This mode also allows you to record the monitoring with ``tracker.flush()`` that writes the emissions to disk or call the API depending on the configuration, but keep running the experiment.

If you want to monitor small piece of code, like a model inference, you could use the task manager:


.. code-block:: python

    try:
        tracker = EmissionsTracker(project_name="bert_inference", measure_power_secs=10)
        tracker.start_task("load dataset")
        dataset = load_dataset("imdb", split="test")
        imdb_emissions = tracker.stop_task()
        tracker.start_task("build model")
        model = build_model()
        model_emissions = tracker.stop_task()
    finally:
        _ = tracker.stop()

This way CodeCarbon will track the emissions of each task .
The task will not be written to disk to prevent overhead, you have to get the results from the return of ``stop_task()``.
If no name is provided, CodeCarbon will generate a uuid.

Please note that you can't use task mode and normal mode at the same time. Because ``start_task`` will stop the scheduler as we do not want it to interfere with the task measurement.

Context manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``Emissions tracker`` also works as a context manager.

.. code-block:: python

    from codecarbon import EmissionsTracker

    with EmissionsTracker() as tracker:
        # Compute intensive training code goes here

This mode is recommended when you want to monitor a specific block of code.

Decorator
~~~~~~~~~
In case the training code base is wrapped in a function, users can use the decorator ``@track_emissions`` within the function to enable tracking
emissions of the training code.

.. code-block:: python

   from codecarbon import track_emissions

   @track_emissions
   def training_loop():
       # Compute intensive training code goes here

This mode is recommended if you have a training function.

.. note::
    This will write a csv file named emissions.csv in the current directory

Offline Mode
------------
An offline version is available to support restricted environments without internet access. The internal computations remain unchanged; however,
a ``country_iso_code`` parameter, which corresponds to the 3-letter alphabet ISO Code of the country where the compute infrastructure is hosted, is required to fetch Carbon Intensity details of the regional electricity used. A complete list of country ISO codes can be found on `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes>`_.

Explicit Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Developers can use the ``OfflineEmissionsTracker`` object to track emissions as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   from codecarbon import OfflineEmissionsTracker
   tracker = OfflineEmissionsTracker(country_iso_code="CAN")
   tracker.start()
   # GPU intensive training code
   tracker.stop()

Context manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``OfflineEmissionsTracker`` also works as a context manager

.. code-block:: python

    from codecarbon import OfflineEmissionsTracker

    with OfflineEmissionsTracker() as tracker:
    # GPU intensive training code  goes here


Decorator
~~~~~~~~~
The ``track_emissions`` decorator in offline mode requires following two parameters:

- ``offline`` needs to be set to ``True``, which defaults to ``False`` for online mode.
- ``country_iso_code`` the 3-letter alphabet ISO Code of the country where the compute infrastructure is hosted

.. code-block:: python

   from codecarbon import track_emissions
   @track_emissions(offline=True, country_iso_code="CAN")
   def training_loop():
       # training code goes here
       pass


The Carbon emissions will be saved to a ``emissions.csv`` file in the same directory. Please refer to the :ref:`complete API <parameters>` for
additional parameters and configuration options.


Configuration
=============

Configuration priority
----------------------

CodeCarbon is structured so that you can configure it in a hierarchical manner:
    * *global* parameters in your home folder ``~/.codecarbon.config``
    * *local* parameters (with respect to the current working directory) in ``./.codecarbon.config``
    * *environment variables* parameters starting with ``CODECARBON_``
    * *script* parameters in the tracker's initialization as ``EmissionsTracker(param=value)``

.. warning:: Configuration files **must** be named ``.codecarbon.config`` and start with a section header ``[codecarbon]`` as the first line in the file.

For instance:

* ``~/.codecarbon.config``

    .. code-block:: bash

            [codecarbon]
            measure_power_secs=10
            save_to_file=local-overwrite
            emissions_endpoint=localhost:7777


* ``./.codecarbon.config`` will override ``~/.codecarbon.config`` if the same parameter is set in both files :

	.. code-block:: bash

            [codecarbon]
            save_to_file = true
            output_dir = /Users/victor/emissions
            co2_signal_api_token=script-overwrite
            experiment_id = 235b1da5-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-893681599d2c
            log_level = DEBUG
            tracking_mode = process

* environment variables will override ``./.codecarbon.config`` if the same parameter is set in both files :

	.. code-block:: bash

            export CODECARBON_GPU_IDS="0, 1"
            export CODECARBON_LOG_LEVEL="WARNING"


* script parameters will override environment variables if the same parameter is set in both:

	.. code-block:: python

	     EmissionsTracker(
            api_call_interval=4,
            save_to_api=True,
            co2_signal_api_token="some-token")

Yields attributes:

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "measure_power_secs": 10,  # from ~/.codecarbon.config
        "save_to_file": True,   # from ./.codecarbon.config (override ~/.codecarbon.config)
        "api_call_interval": 4, # from script
        "save_to_api": True,   # from script
        "experiment_id": "235b1da5-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-893681599d2c", # from ./.codecarbon.config
        "log_level": "WARNING", # from environment variable (override ./.codecarbon.config)
        "tracking_mode": "process", # from ./.codecarbon.config
        "emissions_endpoint": "localhost:7777", # from ~/.codecarbon.config
        "output_dir": "/Users/victor/emissions", # from ./.codecarbon.config
        "co2_signal_api_token": "some-token", # from script (override ./.codecarbon.config)
        "gpu_ids": [0, 1], # from environment variable
    }

.. |ConfigParser| replace:: ``ConfigParser``
.. _ConfigParser: https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#module-configparser

.. note:: If you're wondering about the configuration files' syntax, be aware that under the hood ``codecarbon`` uses |ConfigParser|_ which relies on the `INI syntax <https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#supported-ini-file-structure>`_.

Access internet through proxy server
------------------------------------

If you need a proxy to access internet, which is needed to call a Web API, like `Codecarbon API <https://api.codecarbon.io/docs>`_, you have to set environment variable ``HTTPS_PROXY``, or *HTTP_PROXY* if calling an ``http://`` endpoint.

You could do it in your shell:

.. code-block:: shell

    export HTTPS_PROXY="http://0.0.0.0:0000"

Or in your Python code:

.. code-block:: python

    import os

    os.environ["HTTPS_PROXY"] = "http://0.0.0.0:0000"

For more information, please read the `requests library proxy documentation <https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#proxies>`_

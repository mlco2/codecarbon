Comet Integration
===========================


CodeCarbon can be automatically integrated with `Comet <https://www.comet.ml/site/>`__ for experiment tracking and visualization. Comet provides data scientists with powerful tools to track, compare, explain, and reproduce their experiments. Now, with CodeCarbon you can easily track the carbon footprint of your jobs along with your training metrics, hyperparameters, dataset samples, artifacts, and more.

To get started with the Comet-CodeCarbon integration, make sure you have comet-ml installed:

.. code-block:: python

    pip install comet_ml>=3.2.2


Go to `Comet's website <https://www.comet.ml/site/>`__  and create a free account. From your account settings page, copy your personal API key.

In the `mnist-comet.py <https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon/blob/master/examples/mnist-comet.py>`_ example file, replace the placeholder code with your API key:

.. code-block:: python

    experiment = Experiment(api_key="YOUR API KEY")


Run your experiment and click on the link in stdout to be taken back to the Comet UI. You'll automatically see your metrics, hyperparameters, graph definition, system and environment details, and more.

Comet will automatically create an ``EmissionsTracker`` object from the ``codecarbon`` package when your code runs. To visualize the carbon footprint of your experiment, go to the ``Panel`` tab in the left sidebar and click ``Add Panel``.

From the Panel Gallery click the ``Public`` tab and search for ``CodeCarbon Footprint``. Once you've found it, add it to your Experiment.

Now back in the ``Panels`` tab you'll see your CodeCarbon Footprint visualization in the Comet UI. To render the visualization by default, save your ``View``. And voil√†! Every time you run your experiments, you'll be able to visualize your CodeCarbon emissions data alongside everything else you need to track for your research.

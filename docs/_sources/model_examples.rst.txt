Impact of time of year and region
---------------------------------------

Carbon emissions that would be emitted from training BERT (language modeling on 8 V100s for 36 hours) in different locations:

            :alt: Models emissions comparison

In this case study, time of year might not be relevant in most cases, but localisation can have a great impact on carbon emissions.

Here, and in the graph below, emissions equivalent are estimated using Microsoft Azure cloud tools.
CodeCarbon has developed its own measuring tools. The result could be different.

Comparisons
---------------------

Emissions for the 11 described models can be displayed as below:

.. image:: ./images/model_emission_comparison.png
            :align: center
            :alt: Models emissions comparison

The black line represents the average emissions (across regions and time of year).
The light blue represents the first and fourth quartiles.
On the right side, equivalent sources of emissions are displayed as comparison points (source : `US Environmental Protection Agency <https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator>`_).
NB : presented on a log scale

Installing CodeCarbon
=====================


From PyPi repository
--------------------

The package is hosted on the pip repository `here <https://pypi.org/project/codecarbon/>`__.

To install the package, run the following command in your terminal.

.. code-block::  bash

    pip install codecarbon

Using Conda environments
------------------------

If you're using Conda for environment management, you can install CodeCarbon with pip in your Conda environment:

.. code-block::  bash

    conda create --name codecarbon
    conda activate codecarbon
    pip install codecarbon

..  note::

    While CodeCarbon can be used in Conda environments, we no longer maintain Conda packages. We recommend using ``pip install codecarbon`` within your Conda environment, which works seamlessly with Conda.

..  note::

    We recommend using Python 3.8 or above.

CSV

The package has an in-built logger that logs data into a CSV file named ``emissions.csv`` in the ``output_dir``, provided as an
input parameter (defaults to the current directory), for each experiment tracked across projects.

..  note::

    Developers can enhance the Output interface, based on requirements. For example, to log into a database, by implementing a custom Class
    that is a derived implementation of base class ``BaseOutput`` at ``codecarbon/output.py``

Prometheus
----------

Using CodeCarbon with prometheus
`````````````````````````````````

`Prometheus <https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus>`_ is a systems and service monitoring system. It collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays the results, and can trigger alerts when specified conditions are observed.

CodeCarbon exposes all its metrics with the suffix `codecarbon_`.

Current version uses pushgateway mode. If your pushgateway server needs auth, set your environment values `PROMETHEUS_USERNAME` and `PROMETHEUS_PASSWORD` so codecarbon is able to push the metrics.

How to test in local
````````````````````

Deploy a local version of Prometheus + Prometheus Pushgateway

.. code-block:: shell

  docker-compose up


Run your EmissionTracker as usual, but with the parameter `save_to_prometheus` as True.
e.g.

.. code-block:: python

  ...
  tracker = OfflineEmissionsTracker(
              project_name=self.project_name,
              country_iso_code="USA",
              save_to_prometheus=True,
          )
  tracker.start()
  ...


Go to `localhost:9090 <http://localhost:9090>`_. Search for `codecarbon_`. You will see all the metrics there.

Logfire
----------

Using CodeCarbon with logfire
`````````````````````````````````

`Logfire <https://docs.pydantic.dev/logfire/>`_ is an observability platform. 

CodeCarbon exposes all its metrics with the suffix `codecarbon_`.


How to use it
````````````````````

Run your EmissionTracker as usual, but with the parameter `save_to_logfire` as True.
e.g.

.. code-block:: python

  ...
  tracker = OfflineEmissionsTracker(
              project_name=self.project_name,
              country_iso_code="USA",
              save_to_logfire=True,
          )
  tracker.start()
  ...

The first time it will ask to log in into Logfire. Once you log in and set the default logfire project, you are good to go, the metrics will appear following the format `codecarbon_*`.


HTTP Output
-----------

The HTTP Output allow the call of a webhook with emission data when the tracker is stopped.

CodeCarbon API
--------------

You can send all the data to the CodeCarbon API. So you have all your historical data in one place. By default, nothing is sent to the API.

Logger Output
-------------

See :ref:`Collecting emissions to a logger<Collecting emissions to a logger>`.
